# Flight-Delay-ML_Project
ML project for predicting flights delay

This project consists of three modules:

1. Data Preprocessing 
2. Classification 
3. Regression 

The code has been split into many jupyter Notebooks:

1. Data Preprocessing:
     - Flight code ( Cleaning Flight data) 
     - Merge_Weather ( Cleaning and merging of weather data )
     - Merge_Final ( Acquiring the best merge file)
2. Classification:
     - Module2 
3. Regression
     - Module3
     
Final report: Flight Delay report
